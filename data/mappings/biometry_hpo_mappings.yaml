# HPO term mappings for fetal biometric measurements.
# Each measurement type maps percentile bins to appropriate HPO terms.
#
# Bin Keys (from MeasurementResult):
#   - below_3p: < 3rd percentile
#   - between_3p_5p: 3rd-5th percentile
#   - between_5p_10p: 5th-10th percentile
#   - between_10p_50p: 10th-50th percentile (normal range)
#   - between_50p_90p: 50th-90th percentile (normal range)
#   - between_90p_95p: 90th-95th percentile
#   - between_95p_97p: 95th-97th percentile
#   - above_97p: > 97th percentile
