# Femur Length (FL)

## Data sources
- **INTERGROWTH-21st**: Centile and z-score tables for FL.  
- **NICHD**: Race/ethnicity-stratified percentiles.  

## Mapping strategy
- FL is a strong predictor of gestational age when combined with head circumference.  
- Very short FL (<5th percentile) may indicate skeletal dysplasia or growth restriction.  

## Planned extensions
- Add direct z-score computation and cross-standard comparisons.
