# Abdominal Circumference (AC)

## Data sources
- **INTERGROWTH-21st**:  
 - Centiles (3rd-97th):contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}.  
 - Z-scores (-3 to +3 SD):contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}.  
- **NICHD**: Population-stratified percentiles for AC.  

## Mapping strategy
- AC is especially important for diagnosing fetal growth restriction (FGR).  
- Values <10th percentile are considered abnormal, particularly when combined with low estimated fetal weight.  

## Planned extensions
- Harmonize AC interpretation across standards.  
- Integrate with estimated fetal weight formulas (Hadlock, INTERGROWTH).
