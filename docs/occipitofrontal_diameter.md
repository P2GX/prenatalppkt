# Occipito-Frontal Diameter (OFD)

## Data sources
- **INTERGROWTH-21st**: Centile and z-score tables for OFD.  
- **NICHD**: Does *not* include OFD as a standard measurement.  

## Mapping strategy
- OFD is often used in combination with BPD to compute head circumference.  
- Not typically interpreted in isolation, but values <3rd or >97th centile may flag abnormal skull shape.  

## Planned extensions
- Add derived indices (e.g., cephalic index = BPD / OFD x 100).
