# prenatalppkt

`prenatalppkt` is a Python library for turning prenatal ultrasound data into
GA4GH Phenopacket v2 records.

It focuses on:

- parsing prenatal ultrasound exports
- preserving gestational-age context
- mapping biometry percentiles to HPO terms
- representing normal findings as excluded Phenopacket features
- carrying raw measurements with LOINC metadata when possible
- building Phenopacket objects that can later connect to genomic data

## Pipeline

```text
raw ultrasound export
-> extract measurements and report sections
-> map biometry percentiles to HPO terms
-> preserve raw LOINC-coded measurements
-> build GA4GH Phenopacket v2 objects
```

## Start here

If you are installing or testing the package, start with [](setup.md).

If you want the main architecture, read [](internal.md).

If you want exact functions, classes, enums, and config files, use the
[](reference/index.md).
